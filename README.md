**INTRODUCTION:**
THIRD EYE- a smart navigating stick that helps the user navigate around places with the right set of instructions through an audio output of the obstacles they encounter. This is a smart stick that the user has along with them, which sense things and let the user know about
the obstacles around them. It helps the user choose and direct a free path when there are free spaces between multiple obstacles on their path. THIRD EYE hereby replaces the THIRD person and makes the visually impaired walk independent without much difficulties and insecurity.

**TECHSTACK AND COMPONENTS USED:**
1) Ultrasonic sensor
2) Vibration motor
3) OpenCV
4) YOLO algorithm
5) Raspberry Pi Camera Module

**YOLOV3 algorithm:**
This algorithm comes under the single shot detection
category introduced by Joseph RedMon. This predicts
classes and bounding boxes for the whole image. It has
high performance speed and accuracy.
This algorithm splits the input image into a grid of n x n
cells. If the cell of the base box falls into a cell, it is
responsible for detecting the existence of the object.
